<p>Elements in a wireless network:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wireless hosts. hosts are the end-system devices that run applications.</li>
<li>Wireless links. A host connects to a base station (defined below) or to another wireless host through a wireless communication link.</li>
<li>Base station. Cell towers in cellular networks and access points in 802.11 wireless LANs are examples of base stations.</li>
<li>Network infrastructure. This is the larger network with which a wireless host may wish to communicate.</li>
</ul>
<p>In ad hoc networks, wireless hosts have no such infrastructure with which to connect. In the absence of such infrastructure, the hosts themselves must provide for services such as routing, address assignment, DNS-like name translation, and more.</p>
<p>When a mobile host moves beyond the range of one base station and into the range of another, it will change its point of attachment into the larger network â€”a process referred to as handoff or handover.</p>
<p>we can classify wireless networks according to two criteria: (i) whether a packet in the wireless network crosses exactly one wireless hop or multiple wireless hops, and (ii) whether there is infrastructure such as a base station in the network:</p>
<ul>
<li>Single-hop, infrastructure-based. (vast majority)</li>
<li>Single-hop, infrastructure-less. no base station is connected. However, one of the nodes in this single-hop network may coordinate the transmissions of the other nodes.</li>
<li>Multi-hop, infrastructure-based. I.e. wireless mesh networks deployed in homes.</li>
<li>Multi-hop, infrastructure-less. Nodes may also be mobile, with connectivity changing among nodesâ€”a class of networks known as mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs).</li>
</ul>
