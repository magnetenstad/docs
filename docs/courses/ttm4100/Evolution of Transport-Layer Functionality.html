<h2>Evolution of Transport-Layer Functionality</h2>
<p>We’ve seen a rich evolution in the use of TCP over the past decade. In addition to “classic” versions of TCP such as TCP Tahoe and Reno, there are now several newer versions of TCP that have been developed, implemented, deployed, and are in significant use today. These include TCP CUBIC, DCTCP, CTCP, BBR, and more.</p>
<p>Perhaps the only common features of these protocols is that they use the TCP segment format and that they should compete “fairly” amongst themselves in the face of network congestion!</p>
<h4>QUIC: Quick UDP Internet Connections</h4>
<p>QUIC is a new application-layer protocol designed from the ground up to improve the performance of transport-layer services for secure HTTP.</p>
<p>QUIC is an application-layer protocol, using UDP as its underlying transport-layer protocol, and is designed to interface above specifically to a simplified but evolved version of HTTP/2.</p>
<p>Some of QUIC’s major features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Connection-Oriented and Secure.</li>
<li>Streams. QUIC allows several different application-level “streams” to be multiplexed through a single QUIC connection.</li>
<li>Reliable, TCP-friendly congestion-controlled data transfer.</li>
</ul>
