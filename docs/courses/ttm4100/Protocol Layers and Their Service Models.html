        <h1>Protocol Layers and Their Service Models.html## Protocol Layers and Their Service Models</h1>
<h3>Layered Architecture</h3>
<h4>Protocol Layering</h4>
<p>To provide structure to the design of network protocols, network designers organize protocolsâ€”and the network hardware and software that implement the protocols - in layers. Each protocol belongs to one of the layers. We are again interested in the services that a layer offers to the layer above the so-called service model of a layer. Each layer provides its service by (1) performing certain actions within that layer and by (2) using the services of the layer directly below it.</p>
<p>When taken together, the protocols of the various layers are called the protocol stack. The Internet protocol stack consists of five layers: the physical, link, network, transport, and application layers.</p>
<p><img src="assets/Pasted image 20220421134333.png" alt=""></p>
<h4>Application Layer</h4>
<p>The Internetâ€™s application layer includes many protocols, such as the HTTP protocol (which provides for Web document request and transfer), SMTP (which provides for the transfer of e-mail messages), and FTP (which provides for the transfer of files between two end systems). Weâ€™ll refer to this packet of information at the application layer as a message.</p>
<h4>Transport Layer</h4>
<p>The Internetâ€™s transport layer transports application-layer messages between application endpoints. In the Internet, there are two transport protocols, TCP and UDP, either of which can transport application-layer messages. TCP provides a connection-oriented service to its applications. This service includes guaranteed delivery of application-layer messages to the destination and flow control (that is, sender/receiver speed matching). TCP also breaks long messages into shorter segments and provides a congestion-control mechanism, so that a source throttles its transmission rate when the network is congested. The UDP protocol provides a connectionless service to its applications. This is a no-frills service that provides no reliability, no flow control, and no congestion control. In this book, weâ€™ll refer to a transport-layer packet as a segment.</p>
<h4>Network Layer</h4>
<p>The Internetâ€™s network layer is responsible for moving network-layer packets known as datagrams from one host to another. The Internetâ€™s network layer includes the celebrated IP protocol, which defines the fields in the datagram as well as how the end systems and routers act on these fields. There is only one IP protocol, and all Internet components that have a network layer must run the IP protocol. The Internetâ€™s network layer also contains routing protocols that determine the routes that datagrams take between sources and destination.</p>
<h4>Link Layer</h4>
<p>To move a packet from one node (host or router) to the next node in the route, the network layer relies on the services of the link layer. some link-layer protocols provide reliable delivery. Examples of link-layer protocols include Ethernet, WiFi, and the cable access networkâ€™s DOCSIS protocol. Weâ€™ll refer to the link-layer packets as frames.</p>
<h4>Physical Layer</h4>
<p>The job of the physical layer is to move the individual bits within the frame from one node to the next. The protocols in this layer are again link dependent and further depend on the actual transmission medium of the link (for example, twisted-pair copper wire, single-mode fiber optics).</p>
<h3>Encapsulation</h3>
<p>Note that hosts implement all five layers; this is consistent with the view that the Internet architecture puts much of its complexity at the edges of the network.</p>
<p>Thus, we see that at each layer, a packet has two types of fields: header fields and a payload field. The payload is typically a packet from the layer above.</p>
