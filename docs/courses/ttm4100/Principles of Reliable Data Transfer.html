<h2>Principles of Reliable Data Transfer</h2>
<p>With a reliable channel, no transferred data bits are corrupted (flipped from 0 to 1, or vice versa) or lost, and all are delivered in the order in which they were sent.</p>
<h3>Building a Reliable Data Transfer Protocol</h3>
<h4>Reliable Data Transfer over a Perfectly Reliable Channel: rdt1.0</h4>
<h4>Reliable Data Transfer over a Channel with Bit Errors: rdt2.0</h4>
<p>Fundamentally, three additional protocol capabilities are required in ARQ protocols to handle the presence of bit errors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Error detection</li>
<li>Receiver feedback</li>
<li>Retransmission</li>
</ul>
<p>To enable the receiver to determine whether the packet is a retransmission, we add a sequence number to the data packet.</p>
<h4>Reliable Data Transfer over a Lossy Channel with Bit Errors: rdt3.0</h4>
<p>The sender does not know whether a data packet was lost, an ACK was lost, or if the packet or ACK was simply overly delayed. In all cases, the action is the same: retransmit. Implementing a time-based retransmission mechanism requires a countdown timer that can interrupt the sender after a given amount of time has expired. The sender will thus need to be able to (1) start the timer each time a packet (either a first-time packet or a retransmission) is sent, (2) respond to a timer interrupt (taking appropriate actions), and (3) stop the timer.</p>
<p>We have now assembled the key elements of a data transfer protocol. Checksums, sequence numbers, timers, and positive and negative acknowledgment packets each play a crucial and necessary role in the operation of the protocol.</p>
<h3>Pipelined Reliable Data Transfer Protocols</h3>
<p>If we define the utilization of the sender (or the channel) as the fraction of time the sender is actually busy sending bits into the channel, the stop-and-wait protocol has a rather dismal sender utilization,</p>
<p>Pipelining has the following consequences for reliable data transfer protocols:</p>
<ul>
<li>The range of sequence numbers must be increased.</li>
<li>The sender and receiver sides of the protocols may have to buffer more than one packet.</li>
<li>The range of sequence numbers needed and the buffering requirements will depend on the manner in which a data transfer protocol responds to lost, corrupted, and overly delayed packets. Two basic approaches toward pipelined error recovery can be identified: Go-Back-N and selective repeat.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Go-Back-N (GBN)</h3>
<p>In a Go-Back-N (GBN) protocol, the sender is allowed to transmit multiple packets (when available) without waiting for an acknowledgment, but is constrained to have no more than some maximum allowable number, N, of unacknowledged packets in the pipeline.</p>
<p>As the protocol operates, this window slides forward over the sequence number space. For this reason, N is often referred to as the window size and the GBN protocol itself as a sliding-window protocol.</p>
<p>The GBN sender must respond to three types of events:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Invocation from above</em>. rdt_send(). If the window is not full, a packet is created and sent, and variables are appropriately updated. If the window is full, the sender simply returns the data back to the upper layer</li>
<li><em>Receipt of an ACK</em>. An acknowledgment for a packet with sequence number n will be taken to be a cumulative acknowledgment, indicating that all packets with a sequence number up to and including n have been correctly received at the receiver.</li>
<li><em>A timeout event</em>. If a timeout occurs, the sender resends all packets that have been previously sent but that have not yet been acknowledged.</li>
</ul>
<p>A single packet error can cause GBN to retransmit a large number of packets, many unnecessarily.</p>
<h3>Selective Repeat (SR)</h3>
<p>As the name suggests, selective-repeat protocols avoid unnecessary retransmissions by having the sender retransmit only those packets that it suspects were received in error (that is, were lost or corrupted) at the receiver.</p>
<p>The SR receiver will acknowledge a correctly received packet whether or not it is in order. Out-of-order packets are buffered until any missing packets (that is, packets with lower sequence numbers) are received, at which point a batch of packets can be delivered in order to the upper layer.</p>
