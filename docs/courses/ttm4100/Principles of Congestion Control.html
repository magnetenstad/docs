<h2>Principles of Congestion Control</h2>
<h3>The Causes and the Costs of Congestion</h3>
<ol>
<li>Large queuing delays are experienced as the packet-arrival rate nears the link capacity.</li>
<li>Another cost of a congested network— the sender must perform retransmissions in order to compensate for dropped (lost) packets due to buffer overflow.</li>
<li>Unneeded retransmissions by the sender in the face of large delays may cause a router to use its link bandwidth to forward unneeded copies of a packet.</li>
<li>When a packet is dropped along a path, the transmission capacity that was used at each of the upstream links to forward that packet to the point at which it is dropped ends up having been wasted.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Approaches to Congestion Control</h3>
<p>At the highest level, we can distinguish among congestion-control approaches by whether the network layer provides explicit assistance to the transport layer for congestion-control purposes:</p>
<ol>
<li>End-to-end congestion control. (TCP takes this approach)</li>
<li>Network-assisted congestion control.</li>
</ol>
