<h2>Multimedia Networking Applications</h2>
<h3>Properties of Video</h3>
<p>Video compression. Spatial redundancy is the redundancy within a given image. Temporal redundancy reflects repetition from image to subsequent image.</p>
<h3>Properties of Audio</h3>
<h3>Types of Multimedia Network Applications</h3>
<p>We classify multimedia applications into three breoad categories: (i) streaming stored audio/video, (ii) conversational voice/video-over-IP, (iii) streaming live audio/video.</p>
<h4>Streaming Stored Audio and Video</h4>
<p>Streaming stored video has three key distinguishing features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Streaming. Avoids having to download the entire video file before playout begins.</li>
<li>Interactivity. The user may pause, and reposition through the video content.</li>
<li>Continous playout. Once playout begins, it should proceed according to the original timing of the recording.</li>
</ul>
<p>By far, the most important performance measure for streaming video is average throughput.</p>
<h4>Conversational Voice- and Video-over-IP</h4>
<p>Real-time conversational voice over the Internet is often referred t as Voice-over-IP (VoIP).</p>
<p>Audio and video conversational applications are highly delay-sensitive. However, they are loss-tolerant.</p>
<h4>Streaming Live Audio and Video</h4>
<p>Because the event is live, delay can be an issue, although the timing constraints are much less stringent than those for conversational voice.</p>
