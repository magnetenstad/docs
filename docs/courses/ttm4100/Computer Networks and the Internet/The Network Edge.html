<p>Mobile devices such as iPhones and Android devices employ the same wireless infrastructure used for cellular telephony to send/receive packets through a base station that is operated by the cellular network provider. Unlike WiFi, a user need only be within a few Â tens of kilometers (as opposed to a few tens of meters) of the base station.</p>

<h5 id="twisted-pair-copper-wire" tabindex="-1">Twisted-Pair Copper Wire</h5>
<p>The least expensive and most commonly used guided transmission medium. The wires are twisted together to reduce the electrical interference from similar pairs close by. Unshielded twisted pair (UTP) is commonly used for computer networks within a building, that is, for LANs.</p>
<h5 id="coaxial-cable" tabindex="-1">Coaxial Cable</h5>
<p>Like twisted pair, coaxial cable consists of two copper conductors, but the two conductors are concentric rather than parallel. With this construction and special insulation and shielding, coaxial cable can achieve high data transmission rates. Can be used as a guided <em>shared medium</em>.</p>
<h5 id="fiber-optics" tabindex="-1">Fiber Optics</h5>
<p>An optical fiber is a thin, flexible medium that conducts pulses of light, with each pulse representing a bit. Can support tremendous bit rates, are immune to electromagnetic interference, have very low signal attenuation up to 100 kilometers, and are very hard to tap. Expensive.</p>
<h5 id="terrestrial-radio-channels" tabindex="-1">Terrestrial Radio Channels</h5>
<p>Radio channels carry signals in the electromagnetic spectrum. They are an attractive medium because they require no physical wire to be installed, can penetrate walls, provide connectivity to a mobile user, and can potentially carry a signal for long distances. Prone to shadow fading (which decrease the signal strength as the signal travels over a distance and around/through obstructing objects), multipath fading (due to signal reflection off of interfering objects), and interference (due to other transmissions and electromagnetic signals).</p>
<h5 id="satellite-radio-channels" tabindex="-1">Satellite Radio Channels</h5>
<p>A communication satellite links two or more Earth-based microwave transmitter/receivers, known as ground stations. Two types of satellites are used</p>
<p>in communications: geostationary satellites (remain above the same spot on Earth) and low-earth orbiting (LEO) satellites.</p>
