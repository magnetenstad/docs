<h2>Wireless Links and Network Characteristics</h2>
<p>Wireless links differ from their wired counterparts in a number important ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Decreasing signal strength.</li>
<li>Interference from other sources.</li>
<li>Multipath propagation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Wireless link protocols (such as the 802.11 protocol) employ not only powerful CRC error detection codes, but also link-level reliable-data-transfer protocols that retransmit corrupted frames.</p>
<p>The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is a relative measure of the strength of the received signal (i.e., the information being transmitted) and this noise. typically measured in units of decibels (dB). a larger SNR makes it easier for the receiver to extract the transmitted signal from the background noise.</p>
<ul>
<li>For a given modulation scheme (the process of converting data into radio waves), the higher the SNR, the lower the BER.</li>
<li>For a given SNR, a modulation technique with a higher bit transmission rate (whether in error or not) will have a higher BER.</li>
<li>Dynamic selection of the physical-layer modulation technique can be used to adapt the modulation technique to channel conditions.</li>
</ul>

<h3>CDMA (Ikke pensum!)</h3>
<p>In Chapter 6, we described three classes of medium access protocols: channel partitioning, random access, and taking turns. Code division multiple access (CDMA) belongs to the family of channel partitioning protocols.</p>
