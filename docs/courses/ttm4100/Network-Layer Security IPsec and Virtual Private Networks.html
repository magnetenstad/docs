<h2>Network-Layer Security: IPsec and Virtual Private Networks</h2>
<p>The IP security protocol, more commonly known as IPsec, provides security at the network layer. IPsec secures IP datagrams between any two network-layer entities, including hosts and routers.</p>
<p>many institutions use IPsec to create virtual private networks (VPNs) that run over the public Internet.</p>
<p>IPsec provides mechanisms for all these security services, that is, for confidentiality, source authentication, data integrity, and replay-attack prevention.</p>
<h3>IPsec and Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</h3>
<p>Instead of deploying and maintaining a private network, many institutions today create VPNs over the existing public Internet. With a VPN, the institution’s inter-office traffic is sent over the public Internet rather than over a physically independent network. But to provide confidentiality, the inter-office traffic is encrypted before it enters the public Internet.</p>

<p>the payload of the IPsec datagram includes an IPsec header, which is used for IPsec processing; furthermore, the payload of the IPsec datagram is encrypted.</p>
