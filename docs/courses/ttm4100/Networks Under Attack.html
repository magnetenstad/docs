<h2>Networks Under Attack</h2>
<h4>The Bad Guys Can Put Malware into Your Host Via the Internet</h4>
<p>Our compromised host may also be enrolled in a network of thousands of similarly compromised devices, collectively known as a botnet, which the bad guys control and leverage for spam e-mail distribution or distributed denial-of-service attacks against targeted hosts.</p>
<p>Much of the malware out there today is self-replicating: once it infects one host, from that host it seeks entry into other hosts over the Internet.</p>
<h4>The Bad Guys Can Attack Servers and Network Infrastructure</h4>
<p>Another broad class of security threats are known as denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. As the name suggests, a DoS attack renders a network, host, or other piece of infrastructure unusable by legitimate users.</p>
<p>Most Internet DoS attacks fall into one of three categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Vulnerability attack</em>. This involves sending a few well-crafted messages to a vulnerable application or operating system running on a targeted host. If the right sequence of packets is sent to a vulnerable application or operating system, the service can stop or, worse, the host can crash.</li>
<li><em>Bandwidth flooding</em>. The attacker sends a deluge of packets to the targeted host - so many packets that the target’s access link becomes clogged, preventing legitimate packets from reaching the server.</li>
<li><em>Connection flooding</em>. The attacker establishes a large number of half-open or fully open TCP connections at the target host. The host can become so bogged down with these bogus connections that it stops accepting legitimate connections.</li>
</ul>
<p>In a distributed DoS (DDoS) attack, the attacker controls multiple sources and has each source blast traffic at the target.</p>
<h4>The Bad Guys Can Sniff Packets</h4>
<p>A passive receiver that records a copy of every packet that flies by is called a packet sniffer. Some of the best defenses against packet sniffing involve cryptography.</p>
<h4>The Bad Guys Can Masquerade as Someone You Trust</h4>
<p>The ability to inject packets into the Internet with a false source address is known as IP spoofing. To solve this problem, we will need end-point authentication, that is, a mechanism that will allow us to determine with certainty if a message originates from where we think it does.</p>
