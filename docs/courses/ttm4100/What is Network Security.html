<h2>What is Network Security?</h2>
<p>we can identify the following desirable properties of secure communication.</p>
<ul>
<li>Confidentiality. Only the sender and intended receiver should be able to understand the contents of the transmitted message.</li>
<li>Message integrity. Alice and Bob want to ensure that the content of their communication is not altered, either maliciously or by accident, in transit.</li>
<li>End-point authentication. Both the sender and receiver should be able to confirm the identity of the other party involved in the communication—to confirm that the other party is indeed who or what they claim to be.</li>
<li>Operational security. Operational devices such as firewalls and intrusion detection systems are used to counter attacks against an organization’s network.</li>
</ul>
<p>an intruder can potentially perform:</p>
<ul>
<li>eavesdropping—sniffing and recording control and data messages on the channel.</li>
<li>modification, insertion, or deletion of messages or message content</li>
</ul>
