<h2>Socket Programming: Creating Network Applications</h2>
<h3>Socket Programming with UDP</h3>
<p>By including the destination IP address in the packet, the routers in the Internet will be able to route the packet through the Internet to the destination host. But because a host may be running many network application processes, each with one or more sockets, it is also necessary to identify the particular socket in the destination host. When a socket is created, an identifier, called a port number, is assigned to it.</p>

<h3>Socket Programming with TCP</h3>
<p>They first need to handshake and establish a TCP connection. When creating the TCP connection, we associate with it the client socket address (IP address and port number) and the server socket address (IP address and port number).</p>
<p>When the server “hears” the knocking, it creates a new door—more precisely, a new socket that is dedicated to that particular client.</p>
