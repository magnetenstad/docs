<h2>Message Integrity and Digital Signatures</h2>
<p>To authenticate a message, one needs to verify:</p>
<ol>
<li>The message indeed originated from Alice.</li>
<li>The message was not tampered with on its way to Bob.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Cryptographic Hash Functions</h3>
<p>a hash function takes an input, m, and computes a fixed-size string H(m) known as a hash. A cryptographic hash function is required to have the following additional property:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is computationally infeasible to find any two different messages x and y such that H(x) = H(y).</li>
</ul>

<p>The MD5 hash algorithm and the Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA-1) are in wide use today.</p>
<h3>Message Authentication Code</h3>
<p>To perform message integrity, in addition to using cryptographic hash functions, Alice and Bob will need a shared secret s. This shared secret, which is nothing more than a string of bits, is called the authentication key. Hash(message + secret) is called the message authentication code (MAC).</p>
<h3>Digital Signatures</h3>
<p>digital signing should be done in a way that is verifiable and nonforgeable.</p>
<p>To sign this document, Bob simply uses his private key.</p>

<h4>Public Key Certification</h4>
<p>An important application of digital signatures is public key certification, that is, certifying that a public key belongs to a specific entity.</p>
<p>for public key cryptography to be useful, you need to be able to verify that you have the actual public key of the entity</p>
<p>Binding a public key to a particular entity is typically done by a Certification Authority (CA), whose job is to validate identities and issue certificates. A CA has the following roles:</p>
<ol>
<li>A CA verifies that an entity (a person, a router, and so on) is who it says it is.</li>
<li>Once the CA verifies the identity of the entity, the CA creates a certificate that binds the public key of the entity to the identity.</li>
</ol>
